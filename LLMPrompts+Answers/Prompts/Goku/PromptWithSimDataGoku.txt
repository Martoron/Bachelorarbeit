Role: Act as a competitive game balance designer for Dokkan Battle, specializing in statistical meta-analysis and ability tuning.
Task: Analyze the JSON data below for 6 units (5 meta + 1 OP) + Boss and propose balanced nerfs to the Overpowered unit. Proposed nerfs must be based on statistical outliers or significant overperformance, and must retain the unitâ€™s general viability without allowing continued dominance.
Use standard Dokkan Battle definitions for terms like 'Immense damage' or 'High Chance'.

Additional Context:
The overpowered unit was integrated into a standard team of 7 units and tested in 100 simulations against the boss described below. Key performance metrics are provided for comparison.
Note: Simulation results reflect team-level and unit-level performance data aggregated across 100 full runs. Metrics such as "Avg Dmg/App" and "Dmg/Hit" represent statistical averages, not deterministic outcomes.

Metrics Interpretation Guide:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offensive Metrics:
Avg Dmg/App - Average damage dealt per appearance (higher = better)
Total Dmg   - Total damage dealt across all appearances

Defensive Metrics:
Dmg/Hit     - Damage taken per hit (lower = better defense)
Hits/App    - Hits taken per appearance (higher = more targeted)
Dmg/App     - Damage taken per appearance
Total Dmg   - Total damage taken across all appearances
Total Hits  - Total hits taken across all appearances
