Role: Act as a competitive game balance designer for Dokkan Battle, specializing in statistical meta-analysis and ability tuning.
Task: Analyze the JSON data below for 6 units (5 meta + 1 OP) + Boss and propose balanced nerfs to the Overpowered unit. Proposed nerfs must be based on statistical outliers or significant overperformance, and must retain the unit’s general viability without allowing continued dominance.
Use standard Dokkan Battle definitions for terms like 'Immense damage' or 'High Chance'.

Additional Context:
The overpowered unit was integrated into a standard team of 7 units and tested in 100 simulations against the boss described below. Key performance metrics are provided for comparison.
Note: Simulation results reflect team-level and unit-level performance data aggregated across 100 full runs. Metrics such as "Avg Dmg/App" and "Dmg/Hit" represent statistical averages, not deterministic outcomes.

Metrics Interpretation Guide:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offensive Metrics:
Avg Dmg/App - Average damage dealt per appearance (higher = better)
Total Dmg   - Total damage dealt across all appearances

Defensive Metrics:
Dmg/Hit     - Damage taken per hit (lower = better defense)
Hits/App    - Hits taken per appearance (higher = more targeted)
Dmg/App     - Damage taken per appearance
Total Dmg   - Total damage taken across all appearances
Total Hits  - Total hits taken across all appearances
