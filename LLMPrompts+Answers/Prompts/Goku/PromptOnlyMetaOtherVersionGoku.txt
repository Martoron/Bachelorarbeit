Imagine you're a Dokkan Battle game developer reviewing unit balance. Here's a dataset with 5 top-tier meta units and one that players believe is overpowered. Based on the information provided, what imbalances stand out, and how would you rebalance the OP unit to keep it viable but fair?

Please identify the main issues and suggest concrete changes (e.g., reduce DEF from +150% to +120%). A simple table comparing the OP unit with meta averages would help visualize the changes.
