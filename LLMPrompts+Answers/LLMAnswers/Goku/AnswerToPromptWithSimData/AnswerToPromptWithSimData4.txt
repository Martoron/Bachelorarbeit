Analysis for Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Problem: Goku (Ultra Instinct) shows significant overperformance in both offensive and defensive capabilities, particularly with his high chance of evading attacks and additional benefits from evasion. This allows him to consistently outshine the other units in terms of damage and survivability, pushing him ahead of the meta units. His revive mechanic, while thematic, also gives him near-immortality, contributing to his dominance in simulations.

Proposed Changes:

    Evade Chance: Great chance (70%) → High chance (50%)

    Additional DEF on Evasion: DEF +30% → DEF +20%

    Revive Mechanic: Revive when KO’d → Remove Revive mechanic

Evade Chance	Great chance (70%)	High chance (50%)	Medium to High chance
DEF from Evade	DEF +30%	DEF +20%	DEF +10-20%

Viability Check:

After these changes, Goku (Ultra Instinct) will still be a top-tier unit, but his overpowered defensive abilities (especially the evade and revive) will be toned down, ensuring better balance with the rest of the meta while retaining significant offensive and defensive utility.
