Analysis for Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Problem:
Goku (Ultra Instinct) currently has an overwhelming combination of evasion, offensive power, and self-sustain, creating a massive advantage over the other units in the team. His ability to evade, along with a high chance of performing critical hits and his revival mechanic, makes him disproportionately impactful compared to other meta units.

Proposed Changes:

    Evasion: Reduce the great chance of evading enemy's attack to a medium chance.

    Revival: Adjust the revive mechanic to only trigger if HP is 30% or less, rather than 50%. This will limit his sustain while keeping him viable.

Viability Check:

Post-nerf, Goku (Ultra Instinct) will still remain highly effective with his substantial ATK/DEF boost, but the changes to his evasion and revival mechanics will prevent him from being a one-man army and will bring him closer to the performance of other high-tier units. He will remain viable in most scenarios but with a more balanced role.
