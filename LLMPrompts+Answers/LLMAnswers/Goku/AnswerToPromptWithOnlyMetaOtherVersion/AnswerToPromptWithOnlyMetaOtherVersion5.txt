Key Imbalances in Goku (Ultra Instinct) vs. Meta Units

After reviewing the dataset, Goku (Ultra Instinct) stands out as potentially overpowered due to a combination of high offensive and defensive capabilities, as well as a strong revival mechanic. Here's a breakdown of the major areas of imbalance:
1. Defensive Capabilities

    Evade Mechanic: Goku (Ultra Instinct) has a "great chance of evading enemy's attack (including Super Attack)." This is a strong mechanic, especially when combined with his additional DEF +30% after evading an attack. Most meta units don't have such a reliable dodge mechanic (e.g., Gogeta's high chance to dodge, but not guaranteed like Goku's).

    Revival Mechanic: Goku (Ultra Instinct) can revive with 70% HP when his or an ally's attack causes a KO after being attacked 3 or more times in battle, which is an extremely powerful feature, especially for longer battles.

2. Offensive Power

    High Chance of Critical Hit: Goku (Ultra Instinct) has a high chance of performing a critical hit on both his Super and Ultra Super Attacks. This increases his overall offensive output, especially in combination with his high attack stat of 20,700.

    Ki +1 (up to +5) per attack evaded: This provides him with consistent ki generation, which boosts his offensive output even further, giving him an easier time using his Super Attacks and Ultra Super Attacks.

3. Balance of Stats

    HP, Attack, and Defense: Goku (Ultra Instinct) has a decent balance of stats (HP: 22,350, Attack: 20,700, Defense: 14,525), but the combination of his offensive power (due to critical hits and high attack) with the extremely reliable defense (dodge mechanic, defensive buffs, and revival) makes him disproportionately strong compared to other top-tier units.

Proposed Rebalancing Changes

To bring Goku (Ultra Instinct) in line with the meta, we need to adjust both his offensive and defensive capabilities. Here's a table comparing his current stats and abilities with the meta averages, along with suggested changes.
Metric	Goku (Ultra Instinct)	Meta Average	Suggested Change
HP	22,350	24,000	Decrease HP to around 21,000 to reduce tankiness
Attack	20,700	21,000	Slightly reduce Attack to 20,000 to avoid excessive damage output
Defense	14,525	12,500	Decrease Defense to 13,000 to reduce overall bulk
Evade Chance	Great chance	Medium chance	Lower evade chance from "great" to "medium"
Additional Defense After Evade	+30%	None (or lower)	Remove or reduce to +15% after evading an attack
Revival Mechanic	70% HP revive (once)	None	Remove revival mechanic entirely
Super Attack Critical Hit Chance	High chance	Medium chance	Reduce critical hit chance from "high" to "medium"
Passive Ki Generation	+1 Ki per evaded attack (up to +5)	None	Remove passive Ki generation mechanic
Passive ATK & DEF Boost	+150% ATK & DEF	70-120%	Reduce ATK & DEF boost to +120%
Specific Adjustments

    Evade Mechanic:

        Current: "Great chance of evading enemy's attack (including Super Attack)"

        Change: Reduce to "Medium chance of evading enemy's attack (including Super Attack)" to make Goku (Ultra Instinct) less reliant on evasion for defense. This would make him less invincible while still maintaining a decent dodge chance.

    Additional DEF Boost after Evading:

        Current: "DEF +30% within the same turn after evading an attack"

        Change: Reduce this bonus to +15% after evading an attack, or remove it altogether. This would lower his ability to stack defense quickly after dodging multiple attacks.

    Revival Mechanic:

        Current: "Revives with 70% HP when the character or an ally attacking in the same turn is KO'd (once only)"

        Change: Remove the revival mechanic entirely. This is an extremely powerful feature that can disrupt the balance of longer battles.

    Super Attack Critical Hit Chance:

        Current: "High chance of performing a critical hit for 1 turn"

        Change: Reduce the chance of a critical hit from High to Medium to make his attacks less guaranteed to deal massive damage.

    Passive Ki Generation:

        Current: "Ki +1 (up to +5) with each attack evaded"

        Change: Remove this passive ki generation mechanic. This makes Goku (Ultra Instinct) too reliable in generating ki, which contributes to his high offensive power.

    ATK & DEF Passive Boost:

        Current: "ATK & DEF +150%"

        Change: Reduce the ATK & DEF passive boost to +120% to bring him more in line with other top-tier units, like Goku & Vegeta (Angel) who have +120% ATK & DEF.

Conclusion

By making these changes, Goku (Ultra Instinct) would still be a top-tier unit with great utility and power but would not overshadow other meta units in terms of both offense and defense. This would make the game more balanced, as players would have to rely on strategy rather than a single overpowered unit.
