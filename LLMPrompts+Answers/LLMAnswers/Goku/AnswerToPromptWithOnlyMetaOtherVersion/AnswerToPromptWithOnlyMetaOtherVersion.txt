Review and Rebalance of Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Based on the dataset, let's break down the major imbalances and potential rebalancing actions for Goku (Ultra Instinct).
Key Imbalances in Goku (Ultra Instinct)

    Passive Ability Overload:

        ATK & DEF +150%: This is already a very high stat boost, and when combined with other elements, it makes Goku extremely tanky and high-damaging.

        Evade Chance: A "great chance" to dodge attacks (including Super Attacks) gives him incredible survivability. This is a very powerful mechanic in the game, especially when combined with his additional defense boost after evading.

        Ki Generation: Goku gains +1 Ki per evasion, which can stack up to +5. This is powerful because it ensures he has enough Ki to launch multiple Super Attacks and maximize his damage output.

        Revival Mechanic: Reviving with 70% HP when an ally or Goku is KO'd after receiving 3 attacks or more is an incredibly generous mechanic. This essentially gives him a second life, making him almost impossible to defeat in long battles.

        Additional Super Attack: A medium chance to launch an additional Super Attack gives him more damage output than most units in the game.

    Comparative Analysis with Meta Units:

        HP & Stats: Goku (Ultra Instinct) has high stats (HP: 22,350, Attack: 20,700, Defense: 14,525), but his passives make him perform significantly better than most other meta units in both offense and defense.

        Defense Boost: His passive provides an additional +30% DEF when evading an attack, making his defense very high. Combined with his base defense, this makes him tanky, especially when coupled with his evasion.

        Evasion and Super Attack Frequency: Many other units rely on additional Super Attacks via Ki Sphere mechanics or chances. Goku, however, has high evasion and also a medium chance of launching additional Super Attacks, which makes him very difficult to counter in combat.

Suggested Rebalancing for Goku (Ultra Instinct)

    Reduce ATK & DEF Buff:

        Current: ATK & DEF +150%.

        Suggested: Reduce to ATK & DEF +130%. This would still make him a very strong unit without pushing him over the top.

    Evasion Mechanic:

        Current: Great chance of evading attacks (including Super Attacks).

        Suggested: Change to medium chance of evading Super Attacks and great chance for normal attacks. This would still allow him to be highly evasive but less reliable in dodging key moves (like Super Attacks), which would make him less infallible.

    Revival Mechanic:

        Current: Revives with 70% HP when KO'd (once only).

        Suggested: Remove the revival mechanic. This would add more risk to Goku’s survivability, making him more balanced. Alternatively, change it to a lower revival HP threshold (e.g., 50% HP).

    DEF Buff on Evasion:

        Current: Additional DEF +30% after evading an attack.

        Suggested: Change the additional DEF boost to +15% after evading an attack. This keeps him tanky, but not excessively so.

    Additional Super Attack:

        Current: Medium chance to launch an additional Super Attack.

        Suggested: Keep the medium chance but reduce the potential damage output by adjusting his additional Super Attack’s multiplier to a lower value (e.g., from mega-colossal to colossal).

Rebalanced Goku (Ultra Instinct) - Comparison Table
Stat / Ability	Goku (Rebalanced)
HP	22,350
Attack	20,700
Defense	14,525
ATK & DEF Buffs	ATK & DEF +130%
Evasion	Medium chance (Super Attacks), Great chance (Normal Attacks)
Additional Super Attacks	Medium chance (reduced damage)
Revival Mechanic	Removed
Ki Generation / Spheres	Ki +1 per evasion
Active Skill	Greatly raises ATK temporarily[6] and causes ultimate damage to enemy
Final Thoughts:

These adjustments should make Goku (Ultra Instinct) still a top-tier unit, but with a more reasonable power level compared to other meta units. His evasion and revival make him very strong, but reducing these aspects should ensure that he has the potential to shine without being unbeatable.
