The unit "Goku (Ultra Instinct)" is being perceived as overpowered compared to other top-tier meta units. Let's go through the key aspects of this unit and compare it to the averages of the meta units to identify imbalances. I'll also suggest specific adjustments to bring this unit in line with the others while maintaining its viability.
Key Observations:

    Passive Ability:

        ATK & DEF +150%: This is a high value, comparable to other top-tier units like Super Vegito (150%) and Majin Buu (Ultimate Gohan) (150%), but the combination with evasion and revival makes this unit extraordinarily strong.

        Evasion: High chance of evading attacks, including Super Attacks, is a unique and powerful ability that significantly increases survivability and the unit’s offensive output.

        Additional DEF +30% after evading: This can stack with evasion, which provides an even stronger defense mechanism, especially when considering the high chance of evading multiple attacks in a turn.

        Revive mechanic: Reviving with 70% HP when an ally is KO'd is incredibly powerful, providing the unit with another life, which isn't commonly found in other units, except in a very niche set of abilities.

    Super Attack:

        The high chance of performing a critical hit for both the super and ultra super attacks is another offensive boost that gives it a major edge in terms of damage output, especially when stacking with other damage multipliers.

    HP, Attack, and Defense Stats:

        HP: 22,350, ATK: 20,700, and DEF: 14,525 are very competitive, but it’s the passive abilities that really push this unit to a level above others.

Comparison to Other Meta Units:
Attribute	Goku (Ultra Instinct)	Gogeta	Goku & Vegeta (Angel)	Majin Buu (Gotenks)	Super Saiyan 2 Gohan (Youth)	Jiren (Full Power)
HP	22,350	24,025	25,300	25,063	21,713	20,863
Attack	20,700	22,630	21,650	19,975	21,780	21,525
Defense	14,525	11,175	11,600	14,256	13,594	14,338
ATK & DEF Buff	+150%	+70%	+120%	+120%	+58%	+200%
Evasion	High chance	High chance	Medium chance	Medium chance	Medium chance	N/A
Revival	70% HP after KO’d ally	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A
Additional Attack	Medium chance for Super	Medium chance	Medium chance	Medium chance	Medium chance	N/A
Main Issues:

    Evasion Mechanic: Having both a high chance of evading and an additional defense boost after evading creates an extremely tanky and evasive unit, much more so than any other top-tier unit. This gives it an unfair advantage in survivability.

    Revival Mechanic: The ability to revive with 70% HP makes this unit almost impossible to defeat, providing it with two lives in most cases.

    ATK & DEF Buffs: The 150% ATK & DEF is not out of line with other units but combined with evasion and revival, it makes this unit disproportionately powerful in terms of offense and defense.

    Damage Output: With high chances of critical hits combined with its other abilities, this unit can consistently deal massive damage with its super and ultra super attacks.

Suggested Rebalancing:
Attribute	Goku (Ultra Instinct)	Proposed Adjustment
ATK & DEF Buff	+150%	Reduce to +120%
Evasion	High chance	Reduce to medium chance
Additional Defense	+30% after evasion	Remove this effect
Revival	70% HP after KO’d ally	Remove revival mechanic
Super Attack Critical Hit	High chance	Reduce to medium chance
Rationale for Changes:

    ATK & DEF Buff: Reducing this from 150% to 120% brings it in line with other units like Goku & Vegeta (Angel) and Majin Buu (Gotenks). It ensures that the unit’s offensive and defensive capabilities are strong but not overwhelming.

    Evasion: By reducing the evasion chance from high to medium, it becomes more in line with other units like Gogeta, who also has a high chance to evade but is not as evasive as Ultra Instinct.

    Additional Defense: The DEF +30% after evasion is a very strong effect and helps the unit tank more than it should. Removing it helps balance the unit by focusing more on offensive capabilities and reducing the overstated defensive role.

    Revival Mechanic: The revival effect is one of the most overpowered aspects, essentially giving the unit two lives. Removing this brings it more in line with the other units, making it powerful but not impossible to defeat.

    Critical Hit Chance: Reducing the chance of critical hits from high to medium brings it in line with other units that don’t rely on frequent crits for massive damage output.

By implementing these changes, Goku (Ultra Instinct) would remain a very strong unit but would no longer overshadow other top-tier units. It would still excel in both offense and defense without feeling like a "must-have" due to its extreme power.
