From the data provided, we can observe that Goku (Ultra Instinct) is widely regarded as overpowered compared to the other meta units. Let's break down the specific issues that make him unbalanced, then suggest concrete changes.
Key Imbalances

    Passive Skills (ATK & DEF Boost)

        Goku (Ultra Instinct) has ATK & DEF +150%, which is significantly higher than other top-tier units.

        Many of the top-tier units (e.g., Gogeta and Goku & Vegeta) have ATK & DEF boosts between 70% and 120%, making Goku's passive overly powerful in comparison.

    Evasion

        Goku (Ultra Instinct) has a great chance of evading attacks (including Super Attacks). This is a huge advantage as it makes him much harder to hit than the other units. Evasion at this level is overpowered, particularly since most meta units don't have such high chances of evasion.

    Additional Effects from Evasion

        On top of evasion, Goku gains DEF +30% in the same turn after evading an attack. This further boosts his tankiness, making him effectively invincible for extended periods of time.

    Revival Mechanic

        Goku can revive with 70% HP when KO’d or when an ally is KO’d. This is a game-changing ability and doesn't seem to be present on any other units in the meta. While it’s powerful, this can be considered excessive in terms of survivability.

    Super Attack Scaling

        High chance of critical hits on both Super and Ultra Super Attacks, giving Goku additional damage output compared to the other units. Other units also have critical-hit chances, but Goku’s is built into his super attacks and his passive, making him more consistent in damage.

Comparative Breakdown

Here’s a table comparing Goku (Ultra Instinct) with the meta averages for similar attributes.
Attribute	Goku (Ultra Instinct)	Meta Averages
HP	22,350	~24,000
Attack	20,700	~21,000
Defense	14,525	~12,500
ATK & DEF Boost	+150%	~+70% to +120%
Evasion Chance	Great chance	None to medium
Additional Defense from Evasion	+30%	None
Revival Ability	Revives with 70% HP	None
Critical Hit Chance	High chance	Medium to high
Active Skill	Greatly raises ATK temporarily & ultimate damage	ATK raise or damage-based
Suggested Rebalancing

    Reduce ATK & DEF Boost:

        Change ATK & DEF +150% to ATK & DEF +120% (aligning with some of the other top-tier units). This brings him in line with units like Goku & Vegeta (Angel) and Majin Buu (Gotenks).

    Reduce Evasion Chance:

        Instead of great chance of evading, reduce it to a medium chance of evading attacks. This makes his survivability more balanced without turning him into an untouchable unit.

    Remove Additional Defense from Evasion:

        Remove the +30% DEF after evading an attack. This added defense makes him overly tanky, so removing it would prevent him from becoming a wall that’s hard to break.

    Revival Mechanic Change:

        Instead of reviving with 70% HP, replace this with a once-only 50% HP recovery after a certain number of attacks are received. This would make him viable but not overly oppressive in terms of sustain. Alternatively, the revival could be linked to a condition where it only activates under specific circumstances (e.g., only if HP is below 20%).

    Critical Hit Rate:

        Reduce the critical hit chance from high to medium for both Super and Ultra Super Attacks. This makes him less consistently powerful, forcing players to rely more on the RNG factor of critical hits.

    Active Skill Adjustment:

        Instead of an easily activated ATK +59% for 1 turn, adjust it so it can only be activated when facing a certain number of enemies or after receiving a specific amount of damage.

Rebalanced Version: Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Here’s what the unit would look like after adjustments:

    HP: 22,350 (no change)

    Attack: 20,700 (no change)

    Defense: 14,525 (no change)

    Passive:

        ATK & DEF +120% (previously +150%)

        Medium chance of evading attacks (previously great chance)

        Ki +1 (up to +5) with each attack evaded (no change)

        No additional DEF from evasion

        Medium chance of launching an additional Super Attack (no change)

        Revives with 50% HP (only activates when receiving 5+ attacks in battle, once per battle)

    Super Attack: No change

    Ultra Super Attack: No change

    Active Skill:

        Can be activated after receiving 3 or more attacks in a turn, if HP is 50% or less, starting from turn 5 (once only)

        Greatly raises ATK temporarily (no change)

By making these changes, Goku (Ultra Instinct) becomes more balanced while still being a strong, viable unit that requires more strategy and luck to perform well. This brings him closer to the other meta units in terms of raw power without making him overpowered.
