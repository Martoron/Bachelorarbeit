Analysis for Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Problem:
Goku (Ultra Instinct) is significantly overpowered due to its combination of high evasion, revival ability, and the consistently strong offensive capabilities. The high chance of evading attacks, especially Super Attacks, combined with a revival mechanic and an additional Super Attack, pushes his performance far beyond that of the other meta units. This creates a statistical outlier in terms of durability and offensive potential, making him too dominant.

Proposed Changes:

    Evasion: Great chance → High chance (to reduce his near-immunity to damage)

    Revival: Revive condition triggered after receiving 3 attacks → Revive condition triggered after receiving 4 attacks (making the revival more situational)

    Attack Boosts: ATK & DEF +150% → ATK & DEF +130% (slightly reduce his overall power to balance the offense)

Viability Check:
Post-nerf, Goku (Ultra Instinct) remains a strong unit, but with slightly reduced tankiness and offensive power. His utility is still top-tier, and he maintains his place in competitive teams without overwhelming other units.
