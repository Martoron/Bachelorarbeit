Analysis for Goku (Ultra Instinct)

Problem:
Goku (Ultra Instinct) is overperforming due to his high evasion chance, high critical hit potential, and strong defensive capabilities. His passive provides an extremely high level of survivability (via evasion and revival), which makes him both offensively and defensively dominant. Additionally, his revival mechanic further pushes his power level into the "overpowered" range.

Proposed Changes:

    Evasion Chance:
    Current: Great chance (70%) of evading enemy's attack (including Super Attack).
    Adjusted: Medium chance (50%) of evading enemy's attack (including Super Attack).

    Revival Mechanic:
    Current: Revives with 70% HP recovered when the character or an ally is KO'd (once only).
    Adjusted: Revives with 50% HP recovered when the character or an ally is KO'd (once only).

Viability Check:
Post-nerf, Goku (Ultra Instinct) remains a strong unit with solid offensive power and good defensive utility. However, his survival potential is now more in line with the other meta units, making him less dominant while still maintaining his overall viability in teams.
