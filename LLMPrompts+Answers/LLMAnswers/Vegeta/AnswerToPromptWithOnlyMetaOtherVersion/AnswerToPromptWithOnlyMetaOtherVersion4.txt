Based on the dataset, we can identify that Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta (the overpowered unit) stands out in several key areas compared to the current top-tier meta units.
⚖️ Meta Balance Evaluation

Let’s look at the average values and effects across the 5 meta units:
Stat / Trait	Meta Average	SSGSS Evolved Vegeta	Difference
HP	23393	21688	-1705 (below avg)
ATK	21572	19850	-1722 (below avg)
DEF	12992	15719	+2727 (↑↑)
Base Passive Buff (ATK/DEF)	~132%	150%	Above avg
Damage Reduction	~15% (avg) + conditional	10% base + up to 30% more	Up to 40% total
Revive Mechanic	Rare (0/5)	✅ Yes	Exclusive
Crit Chance (Super/Ultra)	Mostly none	High chance on both	Stacked
🔍 Identified Imbalances

    Over-Stacked Defense:

        DEF stat (15719) is 21% higher than meta average.

        Combined with 40% total damage reduction, he becomes extremely tanky even against Red Zone content.

    Super/Ultra Guaranteed Crit Chance:

        Both Super and Ultra Super Attacks have a high chance (50%) of crit every turn, essentially making most attacks lethal regardless of type advantage.

    Revival Mechanic:

        Conditional Revive (70% HP) is very strong, and none of the meta units here have it.

        Triggering this is not very difficult (just receive 7 hits and drop to ≤50% HP).

    Multiple Scaling Layers:

        Stacks Ki from attacks (+1 up to 5), stacks DR with hits received (+10% per hit, up to +30%), and has built-in additional SA chance.

        These synergize too easily for both offensive and defensive power.

🛠️ Rebalancing Suggestions

The goal is to retain identity (a durable crit-focused unit with revive), while making the unit fairer.
🔧 Suggested Nerfs:
Aspect	Current	Rebalanced	Rationale
DEF Stat	15719	13500	Closer to meta average
Passive ATK & DEF Buff	150%	130%	In line with high-end meta
Damage Reduction	10% + 10% per hit (up to 30%) = 40% total	10% base + 7% per hit (max 21%) = 31% total	More fair tankiness
Crit Chance (SA/Ultra)	High chance on both	High chance on Ultra Super only	Reduces overkill potential
Revive Condition	After 7 hits, HP ≤50%, unit or ally KO’d	After 8 hits, HP ≤40%, self KO only	Adds tension, makes revive harder
Ki Gain Per Attack	+1 per attack (up to +5)	+1 per Super Attack (up to +3)	Slower ramp-up, rewards SA use
📊 Final Comparison Table
Unit	DEF	Base ATK/DEF Buff	DR	Revive	Crit Chance
Meta Average	12992	~132%	~15%	❌	Mostly conditional
SSGSS Vegeta (Now)	15719	150%	Up to 40%	✅ (easy)	High on SA & Ultra
SSGSS Vegeta (Revised)	13500	130%	Up to 31%	✅ (harder)	High on Ultra only
✅ Resulting Unit Identity

    Still tankier than most, but not invincible.

    Still crit-focused, but requires Ultra Super to do so reliably.

    Revive remains unique, but now feels earned and not trivial to trigger.

This rebalancing maintains the unit’s unique flavor while keeping it in check with top-tier meta power levels.
