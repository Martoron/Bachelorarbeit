Thanks for the detailed dataset. Let's evaluate the balance of "Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta", compare him to the current top-tier meta units, and determine why he's considered overpowered (OP). We'll follow this structure:
🔍 Key Areas of Analysis

We’ll focus on:

    Stats (HP, ATK, DEF)

    Passives and Damage Reduction

    Crit and Additional Attack Potential

    Revival Condition

    Comparative Table

    Recommended Nerfs / Rebalancing

📊 1. Base Stat Comparison
Unit	HP	ATK	DEF
SSGSS Evolved Vegeta (OP)	21,688	19,850	15,719
Gogeta	24,025	22,630	11,175
Goku & Vegeta (Angel)	25,300	21,650	11,600
Majin Buu (Gotenks)	25,063	19,975	14,256
SS2 Gohan (Youth)	21,713	21,780	13,594
Jiren (Full Power)	20,863	21,525	14,338
Meta Average	23,160	21,602	13,327
Difference (OP vs Avg)	-1,472	-1,752	+2,392

📌 Observation:

    Vegeta's DEF is the highest by a notable margin (+18% above meta average).

    Slightly lower HP/ATK, but compensated by superior defense and damage mitigation.

⚔️ 2. Passive Skill Breakdown

SSGSS Evolved Vegeta Passive:

    ATK & DEF +150%

    10% Damage Reduction (DR)

    +10% more DR per hit taken (max 30%)

    Ki +1 per attack (up to +5)

    Medium chance of additional super

    Revives with 70% HP if:

        HP ≤ 50% and

        Character received 7+ attacks and

        A unit dies in the same turn

📌 Total Mitigation (after 3 hits):

    40% Damage Reduction

    15719 DEF * 150% passive buff = 39,297 base DEF

        With 40% DR, he becomes absurdly tanky even against red-zone bosses.

💥 3. Crit & Additional Attack Potential
Unit	Built-in Crit	Additional Super	Notes
SSGSS Evolved Vegeta	High chance (50%) from both SA and Ultra SA	Medium chance (30%)	Can stack crits
Gogeta	No crit	Medium chance (30%)	Evasion options
Goku & Vegeta (Angel)	Medium chance (30%)	Medium chance (30%)	Crit after transform
Majin Buu	None	Medium chance (30%)	Heals instead
SS2 Gohan	Conditional guaranteed crit	Medium chance (30%)	Based on team & HP
Jiren	Crit when enemy is stunned	None	Situation-based

📌 Observation:

    Vegeta essentially has a built-in 50% crit chance for both Supers every turn (stacked).

    His crit chance is passive-safe and easy to activate, unlike conditional crits for others.

🛡️ 4. Revival Mechanic

Trigger:

    After 7 attacks received

    HP ≤ 50%

    Someone on rotation dies

Effect:

    Revives with 70% HP — tied for best revive in the game.

📌 Issue: Too reliable and forgiving. Once the setup is done, he gives the team a second life and remains highly durable himself.
⚠️ 5. Summary of Issues
Category	Issue
DEF	Highest among meta; combined with 40% DR = over-tanking
Crit Chance	Built-in high chance on both SAs is unmatched
Revival	Too easy to activate, especially in long events
Versatility	Consistent crits, tanking, and healing make him shine in all modes
Synergy	Gains Ki easily, meaning Ultra Supers and crits happen very often
✅ 6. Suggested Rebalance for Fairness

We’ll tone him down slightly, not gut him.
🛠 Recommended Changes:
Aspect	Current	Suggested	Reason
DEF Boost	+150%	🔽 +120%	Still strong, but reduces tankiness margin
Damage Reduction	10% base, +10%/hit (up to 30%)	➡️ 10% base, +5%/hit (max 25%)	Caps at 35% DR instead of 40%
Crit Chance (SA)	High chance (50%) on both Supers	🔽 Medium chance (30%) on Super only	Less crit-stacking abuse
Revive Condition	7 hits taken, HP ≤50%, KO in rotation	➡️ 9 hits taken, HP ≤40%, KO in turn	Harder setup for a powerful revive
✅ Final Verdict: Rebalanced but Still Meta

After adjustments, Vegeta still:

    Has strong defense and some DR

    Can crit reliably on occasion

    Offers revival (but harder to trigger)

    Remains top-tier in Red Zone and difficult content

He becomes less of a solo carry but maintains his meta value, especially in longer events.
