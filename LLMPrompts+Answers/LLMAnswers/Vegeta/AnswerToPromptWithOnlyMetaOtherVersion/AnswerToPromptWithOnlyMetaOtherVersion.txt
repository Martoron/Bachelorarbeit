To evaluate Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta (OP Unit) and determine what makes him feel overpowered, let's compare him directly with the average of the 5 meta units using a stats and passive comparison table.

📊 Comparison Table: OP Unit vs Meta Averages
Attribute / Effect	Meta Avg	SSGSS Evolved Vegeta (OP Unit)	Imbalance?
HP	23312	21688	❌ Slightly lower
Attack	21572	19850	❌ Lower
Defence	12912	15719	✅ Yes (+22%)
ATK & DEF Buff (start of turn)	~123% avg	150%	✅ Yes
Extra DEF via stacking or effects	Conditional / Limited	Up to 30% more damage reduction	✅ Yes
Total Damage Reduction (maxed)	Avg: ~30% (best case)	40% (10% base + 30% stacking)	✅ Yes
Additional Ki gain mechanic	Common	Yes (Ki +1 with each attack, max +5)	❌ Balanced
Revive Mechanic	Rare (few units)	✅ Has one, with flexible trigger	✅ Yes
Super ATK Effects	Mostly ATK/DEF up or debuff	High crit chance (50%) for 1 turn	✅ Yes (on both SA/USA)
Active Skill Condition	4th turn or HP-based	4th turn, only needs HP ≥50%	❌ Fair
Transformation	Present in 4/5 units	❌ None	❌ Balanced
⚖️ Key Issues (Why This Unit Feels OP)

    Stacking Damage Reduction:

        Starts at 10%, stacks 10% per hit taken, up to 40% total — higher than any other meta unit without sacrificing stats.

        Most meta units cap at 30%, and often have stricter or trade-off-based conditions.

    High Base DEF:

        Raw DEF stat is ~22% above average.

        Combined with 150% boost and damage reduction, creates near-unbreakable defense even without support.

    Revive Mechanic:

        Triggers after 7 hits + HP ≤50% and an ally or self dies — this condition is much easier than many revive units (e.g., stricter HP, once per rotation, or specific characters).

        Adds immense safety with little planning or restriction.

    Crit Chance Built-in on Super and Ultra:

        High chance of crit (50%) on both SA and USA, no condition.

        Meta units either don’t have crits or only on transformation / certain HP thresholds.

✅ Recommended Rebalance Adjustments
Attribute	Current	Suggested Change	Rationale
Base ATK & DEF Buff	ATK & DEF +150%	🔻 Reduce to ATK & DEF +130%	Aligns with meta standards (Goku & Vegeta: 120%, Jiren: 200% but no DR)
Base Damage Reduction	10% base	✅ Keep	Fair baseline
Stacking DR (per hit taken)	+10% per hit (up to 30%)	🔻 Reduce to +5% per hit (max 25%)	Makes total 35% max DR, still strong
Crit Chance (SA + USA)	High (50%) each	🔻 Lower to medium (30%) or SA only	Prevents overwhelming damage + crit consistency
Revive Condition	After 7 hits & HP ≤50%	🛠 Add: Must be attacked in the same turn revival occurs	Prevents easy activation via ally KO, keeps tension
DEF Stat	15719	🔻 Slightly lower to ~14500	Still above meta avg, but not excessive
📉 After Rebalancing: Expected Outcome
Category	Before (OP Unit)	After Rebalance
Max Damage Reduction	40%	35%
Base Buffs	ATK & DEF +150%	ATK & DEF +130%
Crit Rate	50% x2	30% x1 or SA only
DEF Stat	15719	14500
Revive Condition	Easy to trigger	Requires more risk/timing
✅ Summary

Why players perceive him as OP:

    Too tanky and high consistent damage (via crits and high stat scaling).

    Stacking DR + Revive makes mistakes inconsequential.

    Does everything well without a real drawback or trade-off.

After rebalance, the unit remains:

    Top-tier with strong DEF and a valuable revive,

    But no longer overshadows other units with unmatched durability and offense.
