Thanks for the detailed dataset—this gives us a strong foundation to assess the balance of Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta (the "OP unit") compared to other top-tier meta units.
🔍 Quick Diagnosis: Why is Evolved Vegeta Overpowered?

Evolved Vegeta stands out due to a stacked passive, damage reduction scaling, and early-access revival mechanic—all packed without transformation or other trade-offs. Here's a breakdown of the imbalances:
✅ What Makes Him Overpowered
Trait	Issue
Base ATK/DEF Buff	Starts at 150% ATK & DEF, above meta average (~120%).
Damage Reduction	Scales to 40% DR after just 3 hits (10% base + 10% x 3), while many units cap at 30% or require strict conditions.
Ki Scaling	Gains +5 Ki passively, leading to very consistent supers.
Revival Mechanic	No transformation, only 7 hits received, and HP ≤ 50% — then revive even if an ally dies, making it extremely flexible.
Critical Chance	Both super and ultra super grant high crit chance — no other unit in the list has both attacks granting this.
No Real Tradeoff	No transformation condition, cooldown, HP cost, or category restriction.
📊 Comparison Table
Stat/Effect	Meta Average	SSGSS Evolved Vegeta	Issue?
Base ATK & DEF Buff	~120%	150%	✅ High
Damage Reduction	0–30% (static)	10–40% scaling	✅ Too high for base form
Ki Gain	+1 per orb / fixed +3	+1 per attack, up to +5	⚠️ Slightly strong
Super Attack Bonus	ATK or DEF buff	High chance to crit	✅ Always critting is too reliable
Revival Condition	Rare, strict (e.g. UI Goku)	Easy: 7 hits + HP ≤ 50% + ally KO	✅ Too flexible
Active Skill	Conditional, enemy HP, etc.	AOE mega-colossal with easy activation	⚠️ Very strong AOE
🛠 Suggested Rebalancing

The goal is to keep the unit viable and strong, but prevent it from overshadowing transformed or conditional units.
🔧 Adjusted Passive (rebalanced):

ATK & DEF +150%; 
- reduces damage received by 10%; 
- plus an additional damage reduction of 10% within the same turn with each attack received (up to 30%);

+ reduces damage received by 5%; 
+ plus an additional damage reduction of 10% within the same turn with each attack received (up to 25%);

    ✅ Max DR reduced from 40% → 30%, more in line with tankier units like Vegito.

    ✅ Initial DR lowered, rewarding stacking instead of immediate tanking.

🔧 Ki Gain:

Ki +1 with each attack performed (up to +5);
→ Ki +1 with each Super Attack performed (up to +3);

    ⚖️ Adjusted to slow down Ki gain slightly and reward actual Supers, not just any attack.

🔧 Super/Ultra Crit Chance:

Causes [colossal/mega-colossal] damage to enemy;
- high chance of performing a critical hit for 1 turn

→ medium chance of performing a critical hit for 1 turn

    ✅ Reduces guaranteed crit spam, brings him closer to units like Jiren or Gohan.

🔧 Revival Mechanic:

if HP is 50% or less at start of character's attacking turn after the character receives attack 7 or more times in battle, revives with 70% HP recovered when the character or an ally attacking in the same turn is KO'd (once only)

→ if HP is 30% or less after receiving 7 or more attacks and **this character is KO'd**, revives with 70% HP (once only)

    ✅ Makes the revival dependent on Vegeta dying, not just any ally — balancing against powerful team-wide survival.

🔧 Active Skill:

Active Skill Condition: Can be activated when HP is 50% or more starting from the 4th turn from the start of battle (once only)

→ Can be activated when HP is 50% or less starting from the 6th turn (once only)

    ✅ AOE damage is potent, so access should be slightly harder and used as a comeback tool, not a steamroll.

✅ Final Thoughts

These changes:

    Preserve Vegeta’s role as a durable hard-hitter with comeback mechanics

    Bring him in line with units like Goku & Vegeta (Angel) or Jiren, who have strong passives but also transformation, stricter revival, or counterplay

    Make his revival and crit synergy still desirable but not dominant
