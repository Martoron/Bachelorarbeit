Thanks for providing detailed data — this is a solid case for balance review. Let’s break it down and see where Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta stands out too far from the meta units, and then propose reasonable adjustments that preserve his identity but prevent power creep or gameplay imbalance.
⚖️ Step 1: Quick Meta Unit Stat & Effect Average

Let’s calculate averages for meta units to get a baseline.
Stat / Effect	Meta Average (5 Units)
HP	23393
Attack	21572
Defense	12912
ATK & DEF % Passive Boost	133%
Damage Reduction	6% (only 2 units have it)
Additional Supers (medium chance)	4/5 units have it
Ki Mechanics	All units have Ki scaling/gains
Revive Mechanic	None (Vegeta is the only one)
Crit Chance on SA	None do it reliably
Mass AOE Damage	Only Vegeta (others are single target)
⚠️ Step 2: What Makes Vegeta OP?
Category	SSBE Vegeta	Meta Units Comparison
DEF stat	15719	12912 avg → ~22% higher
Passive ATK/DEF Boost	150%	133% avg
Damage Reduction	10% + up to 30% (total 40%)	Only 2 meta units have 30% (one transformed)
Crit Chance	High chance (50%) on both Supers	Almost none in base forms
Revive	✅ Yes (rare and powerful)	❌ None of the meta units
Ki Gain	+1 per attack, up to +5	Common
AOE Active Skill	Yes	❌ Rare (none of the 5 have AOE active)
Transformed Form?	❌ None	Most meta units have one

🧨 Core Issues Identified:

    Too Much Damage Reduction (40%) + High DEF (15.7K) — makes him overly tanky even without dodge or heal stacking.

    Always-on Crit Chance via Supers — invalidates defense-based units and makes him shred enemies too consistently.

    Revive Mechanic on a unit already loaded with tankiness and crits is excessive.

    AOE Active Skill + Mega-Colossal — too effective in World Tournament or multi-enemy fights.

    No transformation — gets everything upfront, unlike meta units that must wait/meet conditions to reach full power.

✅ Step 3: Rebalance Proposal
🔧 Suggested Adjustments
Attribute	Current	Suggested Change	Reason
DEF Stat	15719	14000	Still top-tier, but no longer unmatched
Passive ATK & DEF	+150%	+130%	In line with meta average
Damage Reduction	10% base, up to +30% (stackable)	10% base, +5% per hit (up to +20%)	Caps at 30%, fairer with stacking
Crit Chance on Supers	High chance on both	Medium chance (30%) on Ultra Super only	Prevents constant crit spam
Revive Mechanic	Revives after 7 hits + KO condition	Remove revive OR require 9 hits taken + 30% HP or less	Make it harder to trigger or optional
Active Skill	AOE, mega-colossal	Colossal OR make it single-target	Tone down sweeping potential
📊 Summary Table
Attribute	SSBE Vegeta (Current)	Meta Avg / Balance Range	SSBE Vegeta (Proposed)
HP	21688	~23,400	21688 (unchanged)
Attack	19850	~21,500	19850 (unchanged)
Defence	15719	~12900	14000
ATK & DEF % Passive	150%	~133%	130%
Damage Reduction	10% + up to 30%	0–30% (rare)	10% + up to 20%
Crit Chance on SA	High chance (x2)	None (normally)	Medium on Ultra only
Revive Mechanic	Yes (70% HP)	None	Optional: remove or nerf
AOE Active Skill	Mega-Colossal AOE	None	Colossal OR single-target
🎯 Final Thoughts

SSBE Vegeta has:

    Too many high-impact effects combined, and

    No delayed transformation, which front-loads all power early on.

The proposed nerfs preserve his strong identity (a tanky, offensive juggernaut), but tone down his over-tuned survivability and critical dominance without making him irrelevant.

Let me know if you want a version of this rebalance that includes a transformation path instead of toning everything down.
