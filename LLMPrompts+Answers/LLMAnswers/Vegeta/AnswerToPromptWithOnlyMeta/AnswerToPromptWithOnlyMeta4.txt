Analysis for Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta

Problem:
Evolved Vegeta exhibits excessive survivability and damage output through compounding damage reduction scaling (up to 40%), frequent crits (high chance on both SA and Ultra SA), consistent super chaining, and a forgiving revive condition. These combined traits make him statistically outlier-tier compared to current meta units in both defense sustainability and offensive reliability.
Proposed Changes:

    Passive Damage Reduction Scaling:
    "Reduces damage received by 10%; plus an additional 10% within the same turn with each attack received (up to 30%)"
    ➝ "Reduces damage received by 10%; plus an additional 8% within the same turn with each attack received (up to 24%)"

    Super/Ultra Super Critical Hit Rate:
    "High chance (50%) to perform a critical hit for 1 turn"
    ➝ "Medium chance (30%) to perform a critical hit for 1 turn"

Meta Comparison Table
Stat/Skill	OP Unit (Before)	OP Unit (After)	Meta Avg.
Damage Reduction (max scaling)	40% (10% base + 30%)	34% (10% base + 24%)	~20–30% (mostly flat, no scaling)
Crit Chance on SA/Ultra SA	High Chance (50%)	Medium Chance (30%)	None to Medium (30%)
Revival Condition	After 7 hits, <50% HP, then revive if anyone is KO’d	Unchanged	Rare; only 1 meta unit revives
DEF Stat	15,719	Unchanged	13,792 avg (highest: 14,338)
Viability Check:

Post-nerf, Vegeta remains a top-tier tank and damage dealer with strong utility, but no longer hard-solos content through over-stacked mitigation and crit procs.
