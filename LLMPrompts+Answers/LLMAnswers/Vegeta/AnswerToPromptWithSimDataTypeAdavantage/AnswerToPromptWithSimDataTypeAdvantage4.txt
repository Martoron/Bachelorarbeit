Analysis for Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta

Problem:
Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta’s passive damage reduction stacking (up to 30% within the same turn) combined with a 10% baseline reduction grants him an unusually high effective damage mitigation that surpasses the meta average by a large margin. Additionally, his revive mechanic with 70% HP recovery under fairly accessible conditions is a significant outlier in survivability compared to the meta, allowing extended presence and damage output far beyond typical units.

Proposed Changes:
Damage Reduction Passive: 10% base + up to 30% stacking within turn → 10% base + up to 15% stacking within turn (max 25% total)
Revive HP Recovery: 70% HP recovered → 50% HP recovered

Meta Comparison Table:
Stat/Skill	OP Unit (Before)	OP Unit (After)	Meta Avg.
Damage Reduction	10% base + up to 30% stack	10% base + up to 15% stack	~20% total (varies by unit)
Revive HP Recovery	70% HP	50% HP	~50% HP (typical revive)
Viability Check:
These nerfs reduce his extreme survivability while preserving strong damage output and utility, keeping him a competitive but no longer dominant unit in the meta.
