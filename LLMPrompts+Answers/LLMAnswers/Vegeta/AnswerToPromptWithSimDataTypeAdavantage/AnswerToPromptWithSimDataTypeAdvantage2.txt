Analysis for Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta
Problem: The unit’s passive damage reduction stacking up to 30% per turn combined with a base 10% reduction is significantly higher than meta averages, creating excessive survivability. Additionally, the revival condition (with 70% HP recovery) triggers too reliably due to the low activation threshold (50% HP + 7 attacks received), amplifying his staying power beyond comparable units.

Proposed Changes:

    Passive Damage Reduction: 10% base + 10% per attack (up to 30%) → 10% base + 5% per attack (up to 15%)

    Revival Condition HP Threshold: 50% HP or less → 40% HP or less

Meta Comparison Table:
Stat/Skill	OP Unit (Before)	OP Unit (After)	Meta Avg.
Passive Damage Reduction	10% base + 10% per attack (max 30%)	10% base + 5% per attack (max 15%)	~10–20% flat / conditional
Revival HP Threshold	50% HP or less	40% HP or less	Often 30–40% or conditional
Viability Check:
The nerfs lower his extreme survivability while keeping his offensive power intact, ensuring he remains a strong, viable unit without overshadowing meta competition.
